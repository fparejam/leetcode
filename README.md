# fparejam's LeetCode Solutions

## About This Repository
Welcome to my collection of LeetCode solutions! I started this project to not only enhance my GitHub contribution heatmap but also to document and share my journey through solving various coding challenges. 

Each problem will have my own solution after iterating a bit and fighting with the problem myself. I will document the solution using Leetcode's template and using GPT-4 to tweak my solution into a cleaner explanation. Input for GPT-4: the problem approach I used, prompt asks for a more concise explanation.

I am using [NeetCode](https://neetcode.io/practice) to track my progress and focusing on problems from the *Blind 75* list. You can find this list origins [here](https://www.teamblind.com/post/New-Year-Gift---Curated-List-of-Top-75-LeetCode-Questions-to-Save-Your-Time-OaM1orEU).

Happy Coding! ðŸ˜‰
